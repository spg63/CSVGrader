License: No license, use it however you want. It'd be nice if you left my name on the files I wrote though. 

Warranty: No. 

Changes & Bug reports: Push requests on git, or send me an email.

Bugs: None. -_-. I'm sure there is a bug or 2...I didn't find any issues when comparing results manually for my lab section
but that's a fairly small sample area. 

Tested: OS X and Tux. Requires a compiler that supports C++11.

  - Removes CSVGrader and results.csv

To Run:
  Run: ./CSVGrader codelabs.csv problem_list.csv bblearn.csv -f
  Alternate Run: ./CSVGrader codelabs.csv problem_list.csv user_list.{csv, txt}

Providing a user_list file instead of the bblearn file will simply search for those users in the codelabs.csv and report the
results. 

A more simple way of using it is to provide the bblearn.csv download, no need to put together a user list. The program will
search for users in the codelabs.csv based on first and last name since some users are registered with multiple email
addresses (user IDs). As this was put together rather quickly I didn't take the time to go through and remove the reported
results for the unused email addresses, so users that are registered multiple times will have multiple results returned.

The results are written to a csv file "results.csv" after the searching is completed. The program should take 1-2 seconds to
run against a user list, and an additional 1-2 seconds if it has to search for users from the bblearn file. Results are
returned for all users in the bblearn file. No tabulating of data is returned, however the results.csv file is quite easy to
read.

##Creating a problem list
Put the first problem in the first cell of the first row, put subsequent problems in the rows below the first. Don't put
anything outside of the first column. Should work for .csv or .txt files, only .csv was tested.
